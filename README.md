## Problem Statement
Lack of a centralized platform for developers to upload and showcase and share their UI components. Currently, developers have to rely on various marketplaces or create their own websites to let other use their components. This creates a fragmented market and makes it difficult for developers to reach a wider audience. Additionally, there is a lack of an in-built code editor, which makes it difficult for developers to create and edit their components. 

we have used offlicial nextjs cli to create the project and used shadcn ui for the ui library.
```bash
  npx create-next-app --example with-typescript with-typescript-app
```

## Solution

Our UI library allows developers to upload their UI components and share them to others. The library includes an in-built code editor, making it easy for developers to create and edit their components. We used Next.js for the frontend and backend with prisma, shadcn ui, mongoDB.

Developers can create an account on our platform and upload their UI components. They can also edit their components and delete them. Developers can also view other components and download them.

Our in-built code editor allows developers to create and edit their components directly on our platform. This eliminates the need for external tools and streamlines the development process.

We used Next.js for the frontend and backend of our platform. Next.js is a popular framework for building server-side rendered React applications. It provides a great developer experience and makes it easy to build scalable applications.
